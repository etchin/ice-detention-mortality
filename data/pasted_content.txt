Here is a detailed workflow you can follow to extract every CBP‑related death across all years from the ACLU detailed PDF and the SBCC narrative list, then cross‑reference those results with official BJS counts.  The steps are broken down by source and include suggestions for free tools you can use on your own machine.

---

### 1. Download the source documents

1. **ACLU detailed tracker**

   * Visit the ACLU of Texas tracker page: [https://www.aclutx.org/en/cbp-fatal-encounters-tracker](https://www.aclutx.org/en/cbp-fatal-encounters-tracker).
   * Under the “Documents” section click the link labeled “cbp_fatal_encounters_use_of_force_-_detailed.pdf.”  If the link opens as plain text in your browser, right‑click and choose “Save link as…” to download the PDF to your computer.

2. **SBCC Fatal Encounters with CBP**

   * Navigate to the SBCC page: [https://www.southernborder.org/deaths_by_border_patrol](https://www.southernborder.org/deaths_by_border_patrol).
   * The narrative entries appear on the page itself.  You don’t need to download anything, but you may want to save a copy of the page for reference (e.g., print to PDF).

3. **BJS Federal death tables**

   * Download the BJS statistical tables for FY 2016–2017 and FY 2018–2019:

     * 2016–2017 table: [https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/fdcda1617st.pdf](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/fdcda1617st.pdf)
     * 2018–2019 table: [https://bjs.ojp.gov/media/65036/download](https://bjs.ojp.gov/media/65036/download)
   * These PDFs contain small tables, so manual transcription is usually easiest.

### 2. Extract data from the ACLU detailed PDF

The ACLU detailed PDF is formatted as a large table.  To convert it into a spreadsheet:

1. **Convert the PDF to CSV**

   * Use a PDF‑to‑CSV tool such as **Tabula** (free, [https://tabula.technology/](https://tabula.technology/)), **Pdfplumber** (Python library), or an online converter.
   * With Tabula:

     * Install Tabula on your machine and launch it.
     * Upload the ACLU detailed PDF.
     * Select the table on each page (Tabula may auto‑detect it) and export to CSV.
     * Save the CSV file to your computer.

2. **Clean and structure the data**

   * Open the exported CSV in Excel, Google Sheets, or another spreadsheet program.
   * Verify that columns correspond to: Case #, Name, Age, Date, Location, State, Nationality, Incident Type, Minor (0/1), U.S. Citizen/LPR (0/1), In Custody (0/1), Off‑Duty (0/1), Firearm (0/1), Wall‑Related (0/1), Vehicle Pursuit (0/1), Cross‑Border Shooting (0/1), Death in Presence of Immigration Enforcement (0/1).
   * Correct any misalignments (Tabula may occasionally split a single column into two).
   * Convert the “Date” column to a proper date format for easier sorting.

3. **Identify deaths in custody**

   * Filter or sort the data by the “In Custody” column where the value is `1`.
   * Create a separate tab or file containing only these rows; this is your list of in‑custody deaths.

4. **Prepare a full list of fatal encounters**

   * Keep the original CSV as your master list (all cases, regardless of custody status).
   * You can add a “Source” column and set it to “ACLU” for all rows to track provenance.

### 3. Extract additional details from SBCC

SBCC’s page includes narrative descriptions that sometimes provide names or causes of death missing from the ACLU table.  You can capture this information by either manual transcription or web scraping.

1. **Manual option**

   * Scroll through each year (2010–2025) on the SBCC page.
   * For each entry, copy the following fields into a spreadsheet: Name, Age, Nationality, Cause of death, Date, Location, and any descriptive notes.
   * In your spreadsheet, add a column “SBCC source link” and copy the corresponding link(s) provided under the entry.

2. **Web‑scraping option (for those comfortable with Python)**

   * Use `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to fetch and parse the HTML:

     ```python
     import requests, bs4, pandas as pd

     url = "https://www.southernborder.org/deaths_by_border_patrol"
     resp = requests.get(url)
     soup = bs4.BeautifulSoup(resp.text, "html.parser")

     # find each entry: SBCC entries are often organized as <p> or <li> blocks
     entries = soup.find_all("p")  # adjust the tag and class as needed

     # parse names, ages, etc., into a list of dicts
     data = []
     for e in entries:
         text = e.get_text(" ", strip=True)
         # simple example: split by “Age:” etc.  You may need more robust parsing
         if "Age:" in text and "Cause of Death:" in text:
             name = text.split("Age:")[0].strip()
             age = text.split("Age:")[1].split()[0]
             # continue extracting fields...
             data.append({ "Name": name, "Age": age })
     df = pd.DataFrame(data)
     df.to_csv("sbcc_extracted.csv", index=False)
     ```
   * This code is a starting point; you’ll need to refine the parsing to capture all fields.

3. **Merge with ACLU data**

   * Once SBCC data is in a spreadsheet, merge it with the ACLU list on columns like Name + Date or Name + Age.
   * Flag any SBCC cases not already in the ACLU list.  You can either add them to the master dataset or note them separately.

### 4. Cross‑reference with BJS tables (2016–2019)

1. Open each BJS PDF and locate Table 1, which lists arrest‑related deaths and deaths in custody by agency.  Because the tables are small, you can manually type them into your dataset.
2. For each year, add columns like “BJS in‑custody deaths (CBP)” and “BJS arrest‑related deaths (CBP)” and enter the numbers from the table.
3. Use these columns for comparison.  They won’t match the ACLU totals but provide an official benchmark for FY2016–FY2019.

---

### 5. Finalise and analyse

1. **Master dataset** – Ensure your master spreadsheet has a consistent structure: one row per fatal encounter, with columns for all fields and a source column indicating whether the row came from ACLU, SBCC, or both.
2. **Quality checks** – Check for duplicate names/dates, correct misaligned ages, and verify that the “In Custody” flag is accurate.
3. **Analysis** – With the cleaned dataset you can:

   * Count deaths per year and per category (in custody, vehicle pursuit, firearm, etc.).
   * Identify trends (e.g., sharp increase in in‑custody deaths starting 2019).
   * Compare ACLU/SBCC counts to BJS official counts for FY2016‑FY2019.
   * Map incidents geographically or by sector if you add sector codes.

These steps should allow you to assemble a comprehensive list of CBP‑related fatalities across all years and to isolate those that occurred while individuals were in CBP custody.  Feel free to adjust the process depending on your preferred tools (Excel, Google Sheets, Python, etc.), and let me know if you need help with any of the specific extraction or cleaning steps.
