## Cause of Death Analysis

### Complete Dataset (All 250 Deaths)

All 250 deaths have cause of death information available from official ICE reports. The causes range from natural causes (cardiovascular disease, cancer, infections) to suicides and traumatic injuries.

### Detailed Analysis (FY2018-2025, n=77)

For the most recent 77 deaths, detailed medical information is available from individual death reports:

| Cause Category | Deaths | Percentage | Examples |
|:---------------|:-------|:-----------|:---------|
| Cardiovascular | 35 | 45.5% | Cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease |
| Suicide | 12 | 15.6% | Hanging, self-inflicted injuries |
| Infectious Disease | 9 | 11.7% | COVID-19, pneumonia, sepsis, meningitis |
| Other/Undetermined | 15 | 19.5% | Subdural hematoma, trauma, pending autopsy |
| Neurological | 4 | 5.2% | Stroke, intracranial hemorrhage |
| Cancer | 1 | 1.3% | Acute leukemia |
| Respiratory | 1 | 1.3% | Respiratory failure |

**Clinical Observations:**

1. **Cardiovascular disease** is the leading cause of death, accounting for nearly half of all deaths where detailed information is available.

2. **Suicide** represents a significant proportion (15.6%) and is a potentially preventable cause of death.

3. **COVID-19** appears in the infectious disease category, reflecting deaths during the pandemic period.

4. **Pending/undetermined** cases (19.5%) suggest some deaths may still be under investigation or lack complete medical examiner reports.

Counts in this table reflect the current coding in `data/detailed_death_data.csv` (FY2018-2025) and will be updated as additional autopsy information becomes available.

## Geographic Distribution

### Top Facilities by Death Count (All 250 Deaths)

Based on available facility information:

**FY2018-2025 (Detailed Data Available):**

| Facility Name | Location | Deaths | Facility Type |
|:--------------|:---------|:-------|:--------------|
| Stewart Detention Center | Lumpkin, GA | 8 | DIGSA |
| Otay Mesa Detention Center | San Diego, CA | 6 | Contract |
| Adelanto ICE Processing Center | Adelanto, CA | 5 | Contract |
| Prairieland Detention Center | Alvarado, TX | 4 | Contract |
| Imperial Regional Detention Facility | Calexico, CA | 4 | IGSA |

**Note:** Geographic data for FY2003-2017 deaths is available in the source PDF but not fully standardized in the dataset.

## Statistical Findings

### Comparison to Other Custodial Settings

**ICE Detention (FY2004-2025):** 34.59 per 100,000 person-years

**For Comparison:**
- State prisons (2019): 330 per 100,000
- Local jails (2019): 167 per 100,000

ICE detention mortality rates are substantially lower than state prisons and local jails, though direct comparisons are complicated by differences in population demographics, length of stay, and health status.

### Temporal Trends

1. **Mortality rates declined 68%** from the Bush administration (79.17 per 100k) to subsequent administrations (23.35-26.54 per 100k).

2. **Rates have remained stable** since 2009, with no statistically significant differences between the Obama, Trump 1, Biden, and Trump 2 administrations.

3. **FY2023 had the lowest number of deaths** (4 deaths) in the entire study period.

4. **FY2008 and FY2020 had the highest numbers** (27 and 21 deaths respectively).

## Recommendations for Medical Reviewers

### Priority Areas for Review

1. **Cardiovascular Deaths (n=35 in recent period)**
   - Review for preventable factors
   - Assess adequacy of cardiac screening and care
   - Examine time from symptom onset to treatment

2. **Suicide Deaths (n=12 in recent period)**
   - Review mental health screening procedures
   - Assess suicide prevention protocols
   - Examine housing assignments and monitoring

3. **Infectious Disease Deaths (n=9 in recent period)**
   - Review infection control practices
   - Assess timeliness of medical intervention
   - Examine COVID-19 prevention measures

4. **Facility-Specific Patterns**
   - Investigate facilities with multiple deaths
   - Compare mortality rates between facility types
   - Assess quality of medical care by facility operator

### Questions for Further Investigation

1. What proportion of deaths were potentially preventable?
2. How do mortality rates compare between ICE-operated and contract facilities?
3. What is the time interval between symptom onset and death?
4. Are there seasonal patterns in mortality?
5. How do mortality rates vary by country of citizenship or age?

## Limitations

1. **Cause of Death Detail:** While all 250 deaths have cause information, the level of detail varies between historical (2003-2017) and recent (2018-2025) deaths.

2. **Facility Information:** Some deaths occurred at hospitals rather than detention facilities, making facility-specific analysis challenging.

3. **Demographic Data:** Age information is not available for all deaths in the historical period.

4. **Autopsy Reports:** Some deaths list "pending autopsy" as the cause, suggesting final determinations may not be available.
