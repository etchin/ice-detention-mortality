All cause of death information is extracted from official ICE death reports. Each death in the detailed dataset (FY2018-2025) includes:

1. **Official ICE Death Report PDF** - Individual report with full medical details
2. **Facility Information** - Name, location, and operator type
3. **Demographic Data** - Age, sex, country of citizenship
4. **Medical Information** - Cause of death as determined by medical examiner/coroner

### Data Files

- **detailed_death_data.csv** - Complete dataset with all 94 deaths (FY2018-2025) including cause of death, facility, and PDF URLs
- **complete_death_records.csv** - All 266 deaths (FY2004-2025) with name, date, fiscal year, and administration
- **mortality_rates_by_administration.csv** - Calculated mortality rates by administration

## Limitations

1. **Detailed Data Availability:** Cause of death information is only available for FY2018-2025 deaths (94 of 266 total deaths, 35.3%).

2. **Reporting Completeness:** The analysis relies on official ICE reporting. Some deaths may not be captured if not officially reported.

3. **Cause Classification:** Causes of death are as reported in official documents and may involve multiple contributing factors. Classification into categories involves some interpretation.

4. **Denominator Uncertainty:** FY2025 Average Daily Population is estimated at 60,000 based on available data.

## Clinical Observations

1. **Cardiovascular disease** is the leading cause of death, accounting for 45.5% of deaths where cause information is available.

2. **Suicide** accounts for 13.0% of deaths, representing a significant preventable cause.

3. **Infectious diseases** account for 10.4% of deaths, including cases of sepsis, pneumonia, and COVID-19.

4. **Private/contract facilities** account for 53.2% of deaths, despite housing a smaller proportion of the total detained population.

5. The **mortality rate declined substantially** from the Bush administration (79.17 per 100k) to subsequent administrations (23.35-26.54 per 100k).

## Recommendations for Further Medical Review

1. Review individual death reports for the 94 FY2018-2025 deaths (PDF URLs provided in detailed_death_data.csv)

2. Examine patterns in cardiovascular deaths to identify potential preventable factors

3. Analyze suicide deaths for common risk factors and prevention opportunities

4. Compare mortality rates and causes between facility types (ICE-operated vs. contract vs. IGSA)

5. Investigate geographic clustering of deaths at specific facilities
