Key Points

Question: What are long-term mortality rates in US immigration detention facilities, and how do they vary by administration?

Findings: In this retrospective cohort of 266 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in‑custody deaths (FY2004–FY2025), mortality rates were highest during the Bush administration (79.2) and lower in later administrations (23.3–26.5), followed by a recent increase in 2024–2025 under the second Trump administration. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) deaths were reported as counts only because fiscal‑year denominators are not public.

Meaning: Epidemiological rate calculations show a recent increase in deaths within ICE facilities since 2024.

Abstract

Importance: Mortality in immigration detention is typically reported as annual counts without standardized denominators, limiting long-term comparisons.

Objective: To estimate long-term mortality rates in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention using standardized denominators and compare trends across presidential administrations.

Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study of ICE in-custody deaths (N = 266) from October 1, 2003, through December 31, 2025, using Freedom of Information Act Reporting (FY2004–FY2017) and ICE Detainee Death Reporting (FY2018–FY2025).

Exposures: Detention in ICE custody.

Main Outcomes and Measures: Mortality rates per 100,000 person-years using average daily population denominators; rate ratios across administrations.

Results: ICE mortality was highest under Bush (79.2 per 100,000 person-years; 95% CI, 64.3–96.4), lower under Obama (25.0; 95% CI, 19.4–31.7), Trump’s first term (26.5; 95% CI, 19.1–35.9), and Biden (23.3; 95% CI, 15.3–34.2), and rose in Trump’s second term (62.6; 95% CI, 42.8–88.4; TRAC CY2025 ADP).

Conclusions and Relevance: ICE mortality rates peaked early, declined, and are rising again, underscoring the need for transparent monitoring and improved custodial health oversight.

Introduction

Immigration detention is a large custodial system that houses hundreds of thousands of people annually in more than 200 facilities. Mortality is a sentinel indicator of safety, yet U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deaths have typically been reported as annual counts without consistent denominators or long‑term trends.<sup>1,2</sup> Public reports and advocacy group investigations highlight individual cases and possible under‑reporting, but a consolidated, reproducible epidemiological analysis across administrations has been scarce.<sup>3-5</sup> Peer‑reviewed studies have documented infectious disease outbreaks and sexual assault trends in ICE detention, underscoring broader health and safety concerns.<sup>6,7</sup>

We conduct a longitudinal analysis of deaths in ICE custody from FY2004–FY2025, with calendar‑year 2025 updates, using official ICE sources and standardized average daily population (ADP) denominators. Mortality rates per 100,000 person‑years are compared across five presidential administrations. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) deaths are presented separately as counts because CBP population denominators are not publicly released.

Methods

Data Sources

We studied both ICE deaths and CBP deaths.

We conducted a retrospective cohort of all ICE in‑custody deaths from October 1, 2003 through December 31, 2025 using two official sources: (1) a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request covering FY2004–2017 and (2) ICE’s Detainee Death Reporting webpage for FY2018–2025.<sup>8,9</sup> Additional CY2025 deaths were compiled from public reporting and linked in the per‑death index. After de‑duplication by name and date of death, 266 unique deaths remained. Average Daily Population (ADP) provided denominators for mortality rates per 100,000 person‑years.<sup>10</sup> ADP was compiled from ICE reports, FOIA releases, and TRAC estimates (CY2025).<sup>11-14</sup>

CBP deaths were handled separately as counts because CBP fiscal‑year ADP is not public. The US government definition of “CBP‑related deaths” (FY2021–FY2023) includes deaths in the presence of CBP; tables list arrest‑related and in‑custody deaths for FY2016–FY2023 under a narrower definition.<sup>15-23</sup> CBP “Death in Custody Statistics” (FY2017–FY2022) show 0–6 in‑custody deaths annually, with documented under‑reporting to Congress (31 vs. 20 deaths in FY2014–FY2019), so CBP results are presented with reliability caveats and without rate estimation.<sup>24,25</sup> A merged ACLU/Southern Border Communities Coalition dataset (624 CBP‑related deaths; 61 in‑custody) is provided for transparency but not used for rates.<sup>26</sup>

Statistical Analysis

Mortality rates for ICE deaths were calculated per 100,000 person‑years by summing ADP within each interval and assigning deaths by date to administrations (Bush, Obama, Trump’s first term (hereafter, Trump 1), Biden, Trump’s second term (hereafter, Trump 2)).

CBP results were summarized as annual counts by source/definition (arrest‑related, in‑custody, and “CBP‑related”) without regression.

Exact Poisson confidence intervals and Poisson regression rate ratios were computed in Python 3.11 (pandas, numpy, scipy). Causes of death were abstracted verbatim; “pending/not stated” entries were classified as undetermined. STROBE guidelines were followed.<sup>27</sup>

Assignment and Inclusion Rules

Deaths were assigned to fiscal years and administrations by exact date. Primary analyses included deaths while in ICE custody, including hospital deaths if custody continued; events after release or transfer to another agency were excluded. CBP minors and post‑release deaths were not captured in public lists; CBP counts (FY2016–FY2023 FDCRP, FY2021–FY2023 OPR) were descriptive. The Supplementary Online Information and Github repository were created with per‑death source links for reproducibility.

Ethics

This study used publicly available, aggregate/record‑level information reported by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and related government sources. No identifiable private information was accessed; no interventions were performed. Institutional review board approval was not required (non–human subjects research under 45 CFR 46).

Results

ICE ADP ranged from 19,619 (FY2005) to 51,130 (CY2025), peaking in Trump 1, falling during COVID-19, and rising again in Biden then further in early Trump 2. We identified 266 deaths with complete sex, facility, and location data (age missing for 1); annual counts ranged from 3 (FY2022) to 32 (CY2025). FOIA (172 deaths) and individual reports (94 deaths) comprised the set; the latter provide narrative detail for cause/facility descriptions.

Median age at death was 45 years (IQR 34–55); 91.4% were male. Deaths spanned facility types; private/contract facilities accounted for 23.7% of all deaths (eTable 9). Within FY2018–FY2025 reports (N=94), 40.4% occurred in private/contract facilities. Causes were heterogeneous; COVID‑19 was listed in 11 deaths (10 in FY2020, 1 in FY2021) (eTables 7-8).

ICE Mortality Rates by Administration

Rates were highest during the Bush administration (79.2 per 100,000 person‑years; 95% CI: 64.3–96.4). Rates for Obama, Trump 1, Biden, and Trump 2 were 25.0 (95% CI: 19.4–31.7), 26.5 (95% CI: 19.1–35.9), 23.3 (95% CI: 15.3–34.2), and 62.6 (95% CI: 42.8–88.4), respectively. See Table 1 for the full administration‑level summary of deaths, person‑years, rates, confidence intervals, and rate ratios, and Figure 1 for a visual summary with 95 percent confidence intervals.

ICE Mortality Rate Trends

Mortality rates declined sharply after FY2008 and clustered at lower levels for several years, but the annual series shows renewed increase in the most recent period: FY2021–FY2023 ranged from 13.0 to 24.8 per 100,000 person‑years, rising to 39.7 in 2024 and 62.6 in 2025 (CY2025 base denominator; 65.3 using the FY2025 mean; 80.6 using the Jan 12, 2025 snapshot). Cumulative deaths by days into each administration highlight the early steep slope under Bush and the rapid rise during the COVID‑19 period of Trump 1 (Figure 3). Figure 2 provides a three‑panel view: panel A plots ADP by year, panel B shows annual death counts, and panel C shows mortality rates per year.

CBP Mortality Counts

CBP began publishing standardized reports in FY2021. Totals were 151, 171, and 180 for FY2021–FY2023, with in‑custody subsets of 55, 52, and 55, respectively.<sup>15-17</sup> The Federal Deaths in Custody Reporting Program (FDCRP), a separate US government monitoring system from CBP, lists arrest‑related and in‑custody CBP deaths under a narrower federal definition: totals were 10 (FY2016), 7 (FY2017), 10 (FY2018), 25 (FY2019), 19 (FY2020), 49 (FY2021), 44 (FY2022), and 48 (FY2023).<sup>18-23</sup> CBP’s “Death in Custody Statistics” postings list 0–6 in‑custody deaths per year for FY2017–FY2022, and a General Accountability Office audit found CBP under-reported in‑custody deaths to Congress (31 identified vs. 20 reported in FY2014–FY2019), underscoring reliability concerns.<sup>24,25</sup> The large gap between “CBP‑related” deaths and FDCRP arrest‑related deaths reflects definitional scope (presence of CBP vs. arrest/custody events). A merged case‑level dataset (ACLU and Southern Border Communities Coalition lists) contains 624 unique CBP‑related deaths, including 61 classified as in‑custody; it is provided for transparency but not used for rate estimation because inclusion rules differ.<sup>26</sup> Publicly released CBP reports do not yet provide fiscal‑year ADP suitable for rate estimation, so CBP results are presented as counts only. CBP deaths are not pooled with ICE and are shown separately (eTable 10 and eFigure 3).

Sensitivity Analyses

Sensitivity analyses yielded consistent inferences. Using the Transactions Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC, a Syracuse University data aggregation service) FY2025 daily‑series average (ADP ≈ 48,984) yields a Trump 2 rate of 65.3 per 100,000. Using the TRAC January 12, 2025 census snapshot (ADP = 39,703) increases the Trump 2 rate to 80.6 per 100,000, and excluding 2025 entirely produces a Biden‑period rate of 20.7 per 100,000 (95% CI: 13.1–31.0). Excluding the 11 deaths attributed to COVID‑19 lowers Trump 1 to 21.5 per 100,000 and Biden to 20.7 per 100,000; Bush and Obama rates are unchanged. Bounding analyses using the lowest observed annual ADP (20,152 in 2021) and the highest (51,130 in 2025) does not change the conclusion that Bush is an outlier and that the subsequent administrations have overlapping rates.

Discussion

ICE mortality was highest during the Bush administration (79.2 per 100,000 person‑years), declined thereafter, and has risen again in 2024–2025 during the second Trump administration amid increasing ADP. The recent increase may reflect rapid detention expansion with immature oversight and a loss of supervision and procedural compliance. Recent increases also coincide with overcrowding reports and operational responses in ICE detention, including workforce actions related to health services.<sup>28-30</sup> Exact date assignment and ADP denominators reduce the risk of misclassification; counts alone overstate trends. Rates remain below prison/jail benchmarks but involve shorter stays and different health needs.<sup>2,10</sup>

Limitations

Limitations include possible under‑ascertainment of post‑release deaths and minors; preliminary causes in recent reports; 2025 ADP uncertainty; lack of person‑time by facility, sex, or age; unobserved deaths after transfer abroad; and CBP results limited to counts because ADP is unavailable and reporting has documented reliability gaps.<sup>24,25</sup> Media and advocacy reports describe deaths of minors in immigration custody and deaths after transfer abroad that would not appear in ICE in‑custody lists.<sup>31-34</sup> Morbidity and care quality indicators are not assessed. Facility‑specific rates cannot be calculated without person‑time, limiting inference about private versus government facilities. COVID‑19 deaths clustered in 2020–2021. Questions regarding the accuracy of reported ICE detention death data and potential underreporting underscore the need for independent, third‑party oversight of all ICE facilities and ICE‑related deaths.<sup>35</sup> Recent reporting suggests that ICE has not processed claims for detainee medical care since October 2025 and will not until at least May 2026, raising concerns about continuity of medical services in detention.<sup>36</sup>

Conclusions

This study provides an analysis of mortality trends in ICE detention over the past two decades. The findings underscore the importance of third-party monitoring and data analysis to monitor the health and well-being of individuals in custodial settings. Continuous public health surveillance is essential for ensuring the safety and humane treatment of all individuals in immigration detention.

Tables and Figures

Table 1. Deaths, person-years, and mortality rates by administration (FY2004–FY2025)

| Administration | Deaths | Person-Years | Rate per 100,000 | 95% CI | Rate Ratio vs. Biden (95% CI) |
| :------------ | -----: | ----------: | --------------: | :----- | :---------------------------- |
| Bush | 99 | 125,054 | 79.2 | 64.3–96.4 | 3.39 (2.20–5.22) |
| Obama | 67 | 268,076 | 25.0 | 19.4–31.7 | 1.07 (0.67–1.69) |
| Trump 1 | 42 | 158,227 | 26.5 | 19.1–35.9 | 1.14 (0.70–1.85) |
| Biden | 26 | 111,353 | 23.3 | 15.3–34.2 | — |
| Trump 2 | 32 | 51,130 | 62.6 | 42.8–88.4 | 2.68 (1.60–4.50) |

Notes: Person-years were computed as the sum of the Average Daily Population (ADP) for fiscal years within each administration. Rates are per 100,000 person-years. Confidence intervals for rates were computed using exact Poisson methods. Rate ratios compare each administration with Biden using log-rate approximations. CY2025 ADP uses the TRAC daily‑series calendar‑year average (see reference<sup>13</sup>); sensitivity analyses consider alternative denominators, including the TRAC FY2025 mean (48,984) and the Jan 12, 2025 census snapshot (39,703).

Figure 1. Mortality rates by presidential administration, FY2004–FY2025

Legend: Bars indicate mortality rates per 100,000 person-years; error bars show 95 percent confidence intervals computed via exact Poisson methods. Deaths were assigned to administrations by date of death. Person-time was calculated from ADP. CY2025 uses the TRAC calendar‑year average ADP; sensitivity analyses with alternative denominators did not alter substantive conclusions.

Figure 2. Trends by year (panel A: ADP; panel B: deaths; panel C: mortality rates)

Legend: Panel A plots Average Daily Population (ADP) by year (y-axis starts at zero to show absolute variation); panel B shows annual death counts; panel C shows mortality rates per 100,000 person-years. All panels start at FY2004 (study start), and vertical dotted lines mark administration transitions. Rates use annual ADP denominators; 2025 reflects calendar‑year deaths and the CY2025 ADP.

Figure 3. Cumulative deaths by days into the administration

Legend: Cumulative number of deaths is plotted against days since the start of each administration (day 0 = Inauguration Day). The Bush series begins at approximately day 990 because the observation window for this study starts on October 7, 2003, within the Bush administration; there are no earlier deaths in the study dataset. The steeper slope during pandemic-affected periods is visible in the Trump 1 curve. All deaths are assigned by date of death; person-time denominators are presented in Table 1.
